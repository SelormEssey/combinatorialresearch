Combinatorial Research
This repository contains code, notes, and explorations related to combinatorics and its applications in computer science and mathematics. It is designed as a working space for developing proofs, algorithms, and visualizations that help deepen understanding of core and advanced topics in combinatorics.

Overview
The project covers a wide range of combinatorial concepts including but not limited to:

Permutations and combinations

Graph theory and network structures

Integer partitions and compositions

Generating functions

Counting problems

Algorithmic combinatorics

The goal is to approach these topics both from a theoretical perspective and through hands-on experimentation using Python and related tools.
